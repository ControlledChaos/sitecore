# Plugin Assets

A bit of information here about the CSS and JavaScript that is included with this plugin.

## Third-Party Assets

Included are a number of third-party assets such as jQuery plugins, with corresponding stylesheets. These assets files have been changed from their original names to something generic describing their function. The thought behind the renaming is that new assets can be enqueued, for instance, replacing the lightbox JavaScript with another, without having to change the file names in the enqueue functions. However, the original names will remain intact inside the files, as the were downloaded, and the original names are are described below.
