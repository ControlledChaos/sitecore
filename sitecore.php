/**
 * Author's Note
 *
 * To all who may read this,
 *
 * I hope you find this code to be easily deciphered. I have
 * learned much by examining the code of well written & well
 * documented products so I have done my best to document this
 * code with comments where necessary, even where not necessary,
 * and by using logical, descriptive names for PHP classes &
 * methods, HTML IDs, CSS classes, etc.
 *
 * Beginners, note that the short array syntax ( `[]` rather than
 * `array()` ) is used. Use of the `array()` function is encouraged
 * by some to make the code more easily read by beginners. I argue
 * that beginners will inevitably encounter the short array syntax
 * so they may as well learn to recognize this early. If the code
 * is well documented then it will be clear when the brackets (`[]`)
 * represent an array. And someday you too will be writing many
 * arrays in your code and you will find the short syntax to be
 * a time saver. Let's not unnecessarily dumb-down code; y'all
 * are smart folk if you are reading this and you'll figure it out
 * like I did.
 *
 * Greg Sweet, Controlled Chaos Design, former mule packer, cook,
 * landscaper, & janitor who learned PHP by breaking stuff and by

/**
 * Renaming & rebranding the plugin
 *
 * First change the name of this file to reflect the new name of your plugin.
 * Or leave the name since it clearly describes the purpose of the plugin.
 *
 * Next change the information above in the plugin header and either change
 * the plugin name in the License & Warranty notice or remove it.
 *
 * Following is a list of strings to find and replace in all plugin files.
 *
 * 1. Plugin name
 *    Find `Site Core` and replace with your plugin name.
 *
 * 2. Package
 *    Find `Site_Core` and replace with your plugin name. This will
 *    change the package name in file headers.
 *
 * 3. Namespace
 *    Find `SiteCore` and replace with something unique to your plugin.
 *
 * 4. Text domain
 *    Find `sitecore` and replace with the new name of your
 *    primary plugin file (this file). It is standard to match the domain
 *    with the file name but this is not required to run the code.
 *
 * 5. Admin page slug
 *    Find `site-core` and replace with the new base slug of your
 *    plugin's admin pages.
 *
 * 6. Constants prefix
 *    Find `SCP` and replace with something unique to your plugin. Use
 *    only uppercase letters.
 *
 * 7. General prefix
 *    Find `scp` and replace with something unique to your plugin name. Use
 *    only lowercase letters. This will change the prefix of all filters and
 *    settings, and the prefix of functions outside of a class.
 *
 * 8. Constants
 *    See the `includes/config.php` file to change developer/agency details,
 *    plugin name & URL, plus more personal or white-label constants.
 *
 * 9. Plugin URI:
 *    Find `https://github.com/ControlledChaos/sitecore` and replace with the
 *    URI of your plugin.
 *
 * 10. Change the developer backup account info in the `Users` class.
 *     @see includes/classes/users/class-users.php
 *
 * 11. Edit the README file in the root directory as needed, or delete it.
 *
 * 12. Finally, remember to modify or remove any instructional information in
 * admin pages, including contextual help tabs. Remove these renaming
 * instructions as desired.
