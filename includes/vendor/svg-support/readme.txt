Safely upload SVG files to the Media Library. Ability to render your SVG files inline for direct styling/animation of an SVG's internal elements.


== Description ==

**Safely upload SVG files to your media library and use them like any other image.**

But SVG Support has more features!!! Read on to learn more.

When using SVG images on your WordPress site, it can be hard to style elements within the SVG using CSS. **Now you can, easily!**

Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) are becoming common place in modern web design, allowing you to embed images with small file sizes that are scalable to any visual size without loss of quality.

This plugin not only provides SVG Support like the name says, it also allows you to easily embed your full SVG file's code using a simple IMG tag.<br />
By adding the class `"style-svg"` to your IMG elements, this plugin dynamically replaces any IMG elements containing the `"style-svg"` class with your complete SVG code, rendering it inline.

The main purpose of this is to allow styling and animation of your SVG elements. Usually your styling options are restricted when using `embed`, `object` or `img` tags alone.

= Features =
* SVG Support for your media library
* Inline your SVG code
* Works with the new Image Widget (WordPress 4.8+)
* Style SVG elements directly using CSS
* Animate SVG elements using CSS and JS
* Super easy settings page with instructions
* Restrict SVG upload ability to Administrators only
* Set custom css target class
* **Extremely Simple To Use - Simplifies complex usage of SVG files**


== Usage ==

Firstly, install and activate SVG Support (this plugin).

Once activated, you can simply upload SVG images to your media library like any other file.

As an administrator, you can go to the admin settings page 'Settings' > 'SVG Support' and restrict SVG file uploads to administrators only and even define a custom CSS class to target if you wish.

If you only need to upload SVG files to use as images, you don't need to enable "Advanced Mode”. Leaving it disabled ensures the frontend script is not enqueued and the unnecessary settings stay hidden.

**For advanced use:** Enable the "Advanced Mode" under Settings > SVG Support.

With advanced mode enabled, you can embed your SVG images just like you would a standard image with the addition of adding (in text view) the class `"style-svg"` (or the custom class you defined) to your IMG tags that you want this plugin to swap out with your actual SVG code.

For example:

`<img class="style-svg" alt="alt-text" src="image-source.svg" />`

or

`<img class="your-custom-class" alt="alt-text" src="image-source.svg" />`

The whole IMG tag element will now be dynamically replaced by the actual code of your SVG, making the inner content targetable.<br />
This allows you to target elements within your SVG using CSS and JS.

You can remove all other attributes from the IMG tag as it will disappear anyway.

There’s a setting to automatically add your class to the IMG tag for you when you're inserting SVG’s in to a post or page, which also removes unnecessary tags.
Since 2.3.11, you can force all SVG files to be rendered inline with a single checkbox. Additionally, you can now choose whether to use the minified or expanded version of the JS file.

*Featured Images:* If a post/page is saved with your SVG as a featured image, a checkbox will display in the featured image meta box to allow you to render it inline (only if advanced mode is active).

Please Note: If your SVG isn’t showing, it’s likely that it is being displayed with 0 height and width. In this case, you will need to set your own height and width in your CSS for SVG files to display correctly.

*If you're having any issues, please use the support tab and I will try my best to get back to you quickly*


== Security ==

As with allowing uploads of any files, there is potential risks involved. Only allow users to upload SVG files if you trust them. You have the option to restrict SVG usage to Administrators only from the settings page. By default, anyone with Media Library access or upload_files capability will be able to upload SVG files (that is Administrators, Authors and Editors). Please note that SVG files are actually XML which would allow someone to inject malicious code if you're not careful with who has upload privileges.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= SVG not rendering inline since 2.3 update =
SVG Support 2.3 includes a new settings section called "Advanced Mode". Users that were inlining SVG files need to make sure this setting is checked. Go to your dashboard > Settings > SVG Support and check "Advanced Mode". All of your original settings should still be there.

= How do I disable the Javascript on the front end if I am not using inline SVG? =
If you go to `Settings > SVG Support` in your admin dashboard, you can choose to enable "Advanced Mode" or not. If you leave it disabled, the advanced functionality and extraneous script is removed.

= I'm trying to use SVG in the customizer but it's not working. =
To allow SVG to work in the customizer, you will need to modify/add some code in your child theme's function file. [Here is a great tutorial](https://thebrandid.com/using-svg-logos-wordpress-customizer/) on how to do that. The important part is:
`
'flex-width'	=> true
'flex-height'	=> true
`

= How do I add animation to my SVG? =
You will need to edit your SVG file in a code editor so you can add CSS classes to each element you need to target within the SVG. Make sure that your IMG tag is being swapped out for your inline SVG and then you can use CSS or JS to apply animations to elements within your SVG file.

= Why is SVG Support not working in multisite? =
If you installed multisite prior to WordPress 3.5, then you will need to remove your ms-files. Here is a couple of resources to help you: [Dumping ms-files](http://halfelf.org/2012/dumping-ms-files/) [Removing ms-files after 3.5](https://www.yunomie.com/2298/removing-ms-files-php-after-upgrading-an-existing-multisite-installation-to-3-5/).

= Why is my SVG not working in Visual Composer? =
If you are using SVG Support with Visual Composer or any other page builders, you will need to make sure that you can add your own class to the image. The easiest way to do this is by using a simple text or code block in the builder to put your image code in to. Additionally, there is now a setting to force all SVG files to be rendered inline.

= How do I get this to work with the Media Library Assistant plugin? =
You need to add the mime type for svg and svgz to: "MLA Settings > Media Library Assistant > Uploads (tab)" and then it works.
