# Disclaimer of Legalities

This project is an exercise in true open source code without the inherent ownership implied by the issuance of a license, however non-restrictive the license is.

We therefore disclaim legalities including but not limited to access to copy and distribution protections provided by law, and we disclaim consent to be regulated by copy and distribution law.
